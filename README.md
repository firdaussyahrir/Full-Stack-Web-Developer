**Full Stack Web Developer Journey Portfolio**

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository tracks my progress in learning full stack web development. I'm building projects that showcase my skills in both frontend and backend technologies, with a focus on mastering HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

### Current Focus:
- Learning full stack development with modern frameworks.
- Building responsive and dynamic web applications.
- Deploying projects using cloud services and databases.

Feel free to explore my projects and follow along as I continue growing as a developer!
